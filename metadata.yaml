description: It was characteristic of Mr. Philip Quentin that he first lectured his
  servant on the superiority of mind over matter and then took him cheerfully by the
  throat and threw him into a far corner of the room. As the servant was not more
  than half the size of the master, his opposition was merely vocal, but it was nevertheless
  unmistakable. His early career had increased his vocabulary and his language was
  more picturesque than pretty.
